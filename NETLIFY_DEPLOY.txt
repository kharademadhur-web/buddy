NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Your voice companion feature is ready!

To deploy the updated frontend to Netlify:

1. Open your Netlify site dashboard:
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/papaya-bublanina-afa881/deploys

2. Click "Deploys" tab

3. Find the "Drag files here" area

4. Drag this entire folder into Netlify:
   D:\Madhur\ai_assistant_project\frontend\dist

5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

WHAT'S NEW:
- Voice Companion enabled in Relief Mode ("💙 I need to talk")
- Click mic button to speak
- Your voice is transcribed via Web Speech API
- Buddy's response is automatically spoken back
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

NEXT CRITICAL STEP:
- Redeploy backend on Render with OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
- Without it, Buddy will speak fallback responses instead of real AI

Questions? Check the browser console (F12) for any errors.
