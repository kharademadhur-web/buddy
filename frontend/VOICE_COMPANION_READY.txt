VOICE COMPANION UPDATED
=======================

Changes:
- Removed Relief Mode
- "💙 I need to talk" now starts listening immediately (speech-to-text)
- Buddy will auto-speak replies when "Voice Replies" is enabled
- All voice flow uses the standard /api/chat/ endpoint

What to do next:
1) Upload dist/ to Netlify (drag-and-drop)
2) Verify in the browser:
   - Click "💙 I need to talk" and speak
   - Your transcript should appear and Buddy should reply by voice

Notes:
- Web Speech API requires mic permission; allow when prompted
- For best results, use Chrome or Edge on desktop
